Arduino Conductivity Sensor

Plug and play conductivity sensor for Arduino  is a convenient way  to measure water salinity .
Analog unit receives power from Arduino's 5v power supply and provides 0-5v output to any of it's analog inputs.
Conductivity sensor with 1 meter cable and din connector equipped with temperature compensation.
Unit has calibration trim pot.
Unit has a 3 wire cable attached to din connector.

Specifications

Power :  5vdc  with power LED
Range : 0-5 EC or (0-5000 micro/S)
Accuracy: .2% error .Works perfect  from 0-4 EC, Starts losing accuracy after 4000 micro/S due to power limitations.
Temperature compensation: Yes
EC electrode: k=1 , submersible/ inline with 1 meter cable
Size : 3 " x  2" ABS enclosure

Example sketch
This example code is in the public domain.

// These constants won't change.  They're used to give names
// to the pins used:
const int analogInPin = A1;  // Analog input pin that the sensor output is attached to
const int analogOutPin = 9; // Analog output pin that the LED is attached to

int sensorValue = 0;        // value read from the sensor
int outputValue = 0;        // value output to the PWM (analog out)

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communications at 9600 bps:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the analog in value:
  sensorValue = analogRead(analogInPin);
  // map it to the range of the analog out:
  outputValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 5000);
  // change the analog out value:
  analogWrite(analogOutPin, outputValue);

  // print the results to the serial monitor:
  Serial.print("sensor = " );
  Serial.print(sensorValue);
  Serial.print("\t output = ");
  Serial.println(analogRead(1)* 5.00 / 1024, 2);

  // wait 10 milliseconds before the next loop
  // for the analog-to-digital converter to settle
  // after the last reading:
  delay(500);
